This is my first attempt at making a fully-functional first-person shooter using front-end development.  As I recently have been learning more about front-end development, and moving from solely back-end to full-stack development, this is my first attempt at taking what I have learned and making a full project.

This project will mainly run on the architecture of `three.js`, supported by `WebGL` to render 3-dimensional models and render live changes to user input.  Many 3-D games are made using this model.
